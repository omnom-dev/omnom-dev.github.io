## Basic Javascript
```javascript
print("Hello World")
```

Javascript is an easy to learn programming language.  If you use NodeJS, which will be mention through many of the documentation pages, there is a good selection of packages that you can use.  You can install using, either NPM, or Yarn.

### Start Basic
```javascript
// This is a comment
var variable = "This is a string value of a variable."
```

Comments are ignored throughout the script.  So, if you type in:
```javascript
// print("hello")
```
It will not print ```hello```.

### Multiline Comments
```javascript
/**
  * Multiline comment.
  * All of this will be ignored.
  * Good for keeping track of what a function does in a script.
  */
```

### If Statements
```javascript
if (1 > 0) {
  print("Yes.")
};
```
You can also use the ```if``` statement with variables.
```javascript
var num = 1
if (num > 0) {
  print("Yes.")
};
```
